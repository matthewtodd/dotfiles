# `background`, `foreground`, `accent` and `details` are Warp-specific. The
# accent color is the one used for highlights in Warp's UI, while `details`
# describe what detailing options in our UI should we pick for the given theme.
# Options are `darker` (typically used for dark themes) or `lighter` (typically
# used for light-mode themes). `terminal_colors` represents the collection of
# normal & bright colors (16 total) known from other terminal themes (ansi
# colors).
